INTRODUCTION
------------

The CD Database Server (cddbd) is a program designed to allow remote access
of xmcd-style Compact Disc database entries via the Internet. Xmcd is an
X11/Motif-based CD player utility written by Ti Kan, which, as of version
2.0 supports remote access of CDDB protocol servers. While xmcd was the first
application to allow access to a CDDB protocol server, there are now hundreds
of applications supporting the CDDB1 protocol. The list is growing extremely
fast. You can find an incomplete list of such applications at www.freedb.org

Please see the file COPYING for the GNU General Public License.
Please see the file MANIFEST for the list of files in the CDDB server package.
Please see the file CDDBD_HOWTO for information on running the CDDB daemon.
Please see the files CDDBPROTO and DBFORMAT for information on using the
server from an application.
Please see the file CHANGELOG for a list of changes in this and earlier 
versions.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------

Credit must go to:

- Ti Kan (ti@amb.org) for creating cddb, the CD database, and coming up with the
  idea of using the Internet to give users access to the database. His prototype
  is the basis for cddbd. 
- Steve Scherf (steve@moonsoft.com) for creating the cddbd-server-software.
  Without his effort, freedb would not be.
- Jeffery Sumler for sending the patch for cddbd version 1.4b39PL1.
- Oliver Fleischmann for implementing protocol level 4, the "cddb lscat" and the
  "discid" command.
- Florian Maul for implementing protocol level 5 and the "cddb unlink" command.
- Gerhard Gonter for lots of small improvements and bug fixes to the cddbd code.
- Edmund Grimley Evans, Jon F. Zahornacky and Jörg Hevers for implementing
  UTF-8 support.
- Frédéric Leroy for the crunchfuzzy patch to increase the effectivity and
  reduce the size of the fuzzy matching hash file.
- Tomas Menzl for implementing the Windows database format support.
- Ari Sundholm for lots of bugfixes and improvements, especially for the
  Windows database format support.

Thanks go to the many system administrators who have volunteered the use of
their sites as public CD database servers. Without them this probably would
not have become so popular! Thanks also go to the many users who use the
servers and submit new entries every day.


WHERE TO GET CDDBD
------------------

Cddbd servers are maintained at numerous sites on the Internet, but if you
would like to start your own, this package contains the source code needed
to do so. This package can be obtained at www.freedb.org in the
downloads-section. The submit.cgi, which is needed for accepting http-submits
can be obtained separately.

The CD database itself is a rather large package that can be acquired
separately. The freedb public CD database is available via anonymous FTP from

        ftp://ftp.freedb.org/pub/freedb/ 

and many other mirror-sites which are listed at www.freedb.org in the
downloads-section.
