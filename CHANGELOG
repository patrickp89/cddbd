  "log day" command. The log file itself can be displayed with the "log get"
  command.

v1.2
----

- Fuzzy matching of database entries for the "query" command has been
  implemented. If a query fails, cddbd now attempts to find close matches
  in the database and presents the list of matches, if any, to the client.
  Clients such as xmcd will offer the list of alternate choices to the
  user. Different pressings of the same CD may vary slightly in timing,
  so this algorithm is often able to locate database entries that were
  based on a different release of the same CD. So far fuzzy matching seems
  to work well based on this idea.
- The "log" commmand now provides information on the number of successful
  queries and fuzzy matches.


v1.1
----

- The "motd" command. This command will display the contents of the file
  designated by the server administrator as containing the "message of the
  day". This file is intended to contain information relevant to the local
  cddbd site, such as the administrator's email address, et cetera.
- The "log" command. This command displays statistics gathered from the
  message log, such as the total number of messages, the number of
  connections, errors and database accesses.
- Also, several minor fixes were made for portability purposes.
