#   CDDBD sites file
#
#   This file contains the hostname and/or email addresses of
#   remote database servers that are fed database entries by your
#   site, that are queried for log information, or that are available
#   for client access.
#    
#   Remote site entries may take three forms:
#
#       site.domain.com  cddbp [port|-] [flags|-] [pwdlbl]
#       site.domain.com  smtp  user [flags|-] [pwdlbl]
#       site.domain.com  info  proto <port|-> addr lat long description
#
#   It is allowed to have up to one of each form for the same site, except
#   that there may be more than one "info" entry for a given site if it
#   is accessible by multiple protocols.
#
#   In addition, there is a fourth form which is used for describing
#   groups of site entries:
#
#       group_name  group  site.domain.com ... anothersite.domainN.com
#
#   The first form specifies an Internet host address that can be reached
#   with CDDBP for the purpose of uploading new database entries, or for
#   issuing CDDBP commands.
#
#   The "port" argument is optional, and if it is not specified (or if "-"
#   is specified) then the default port will be looked up in /etc/services.
#   Failing that, a built-in default will be used. The port number should
#   not be necessary unless the cddb server being accessed is at a
#   nonstandard port.
#
#   The "flags" argument is optional, and if it is not specified (or
#   if "-" is specified), then no flags will be set. Otherwise, the
#   desired flags for the site should appear with no separating white
#   space. Valid flags are:
#
#       t: Do not transmit to this site.
#       m: Site is running an old server with bad Mime handling.
#       f: Site requires the old xmcd file format (no DGENRE/DYEAR).
#       i: Site does not support UTF-8, so always send in LATIN1 (ISO-8859-1)
#
#   Please note, that all flags except for the t flag only apply to
#   smtp transmissions. If cddbp is used, these flags will be ignored.
#
#   The "pwdlbl" argument is optional, and if it is not specified then
#   no password is used when conversing with that host. If specified,
#   the password corresponding to the password label is looked up in the
#   password file and used when interacting with that host. Example:
#
#       freedb.freedb.org cddbp 8880 t freedb_passwd
#    
#   The second form specifies an email address that new database entries
#   will be emailed to via SMTP. The "user" argument will be combined
#   with the site name to form the email address. The "flags" and
#   "pwdkey" arguments are identical to those defined above. Example:
#
#       freedb.org smtp user - freedb_passwd
#
#   This causes transmit mail to be sent to user@freedb.org.
#    
#   The third form specifies location information for a known Internet
#   server site. This information is displayed as output with the "sites"
#   server command. The "proto" argument specifies the protocol to be used
#   to access the server (so far only CDDBP and HTTP). The "port" argument
#   specifies the port that the server resides at on the remote site;
#   a "-" may be specified if the remote server resides at the default
#   port for that protocol. The "addr" argument specifies any additional
#   addressing information required to access the server, or a "-" if none.
#   For HTTP, this is the path to the server CGI script. The "latitude" and
#   "longitude" arguments specify the global coordinates of the server
#   site. These should be specified in the following format:
#
#       CDDD.MM
#
#   where "C" is the compass direction (N, E, W, S), "DDD" is the
#   degrees, and "MM" is the minutes. The "description" is an
#   arbitrary length string describing the site. Example:
#
#       us.freedb.org info cddbp 8880 - N037.21 W121.55 San Jose, CA USA
#
#   The fifth form is not truly a site entry, but rather an alias for
#   a group of entries. When a group name is used as a command line
#   argument to the server in place of a site name, the server performs
#   the requested operation to all sites in the group. Example:
#
#       north_america group joes.site.com bobs.computer.com bills.place.com
#
#   If the server is directed to transmit to "north_america", it spawns
#   off processes to transmit to joes.site.com, bobs.computer.com and
#   bills.place.com. All three of those sites must have valid cddbp or
#   smtp entries in the sites file. If more than one group name definition
#   appears with the same group name, both lists of sites are added
#   together.
#
#   End of header - DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE.
